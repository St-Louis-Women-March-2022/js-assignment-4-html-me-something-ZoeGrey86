            "I love to make things, I guess that's part of being a Smith. And from my love of making things springs
            my love of art.
            Ever since I was little I've found joy in drawing, painting, or occasionally sculpting. Though I never
            had any ambition to
            make my living from my art, I do enjoy sharing my art with anyone willing to look. So if you care to
            subject yourself to a selection
            of my artwork from way back to up until present, please continue and enjoy.

               A pencil drawing of Norma Jean Baker, better know as Marylin Monroe. the photo this was drwn from was
               taken in 1956
               though I didn't draw this until 2006, just sixty years later. Marylin was such an icon and I've always
               admired her, though I
               wouldn't fully understand why until some years later.

            <p id="leftOf">
               HighSchool was a time of much heart ache. As you can see in this colored pencil and ink drawing with it's
               bright colors,
               dark lines and vivid imagery a sort of toonish style that I develop a love/hate relationship with, that I
               often return to.
               Though HighSchool is long over I still enjoy looking at this picture from time to time as a way of
               reminding myself that
               I once cared about stupid little things, and all things come to pass.

            <p id="rightOf">
               The years after HighSchool didn't get to much better. A lack of direction, a tragic falling out with
               friends, and supressing
               who I am and wanted to be left me pretty severally depressed. You can see in this pencil sketch on paper
               some of the
               anguish I internalized for decades. In denial and afraid of myself, it can still bring tears to my eyes
               to remember the
               level of self loathing I subjected myself to.

            <p id="rightOf">
               This series was a fun night, one who's influnces are a story for another time. But in this mixed media
               triplet you can get a feel
               of the wild abandon and free spirit that was flowing that night. The elegance of the women in gowns
               providing a stark contrast to the abstract
               background that nearly clashes with itself is a favorit of many. And while offers were made to purchase
               any one of these, I could not bring myself to part
               with this set.

            <p id="leftOf">
               I love the stark contrast in this piece between the black and white, very clean line person 
               and everything around them just an array of colors with a very fluid motion. This acrylic on canvas board was a 
               product of the pandimic and too much time on my hands, a difficult time for me with many personal losses.
               This painting stirs many emotions for me.

            <p id="rightOf">
              This piece shares a similar to the last, an acrylic on canvas board, painted during the pandimic.
              this peice features a winged person falling amid a flaming sky, likely exhausted from an intensive battle.
              And another fine example of the toonish style I can't seem to get away from and the feeling of defeat and stress of the 
              anti-LGBTQ+ agenda that was being perpetrated.
